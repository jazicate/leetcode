To convert a top-down solution to a bottom-up one:
1. Initialize an array dp that is sized according to the state variables. 
  For example, let's say the input to the problem was an array nums and an 
  integer k that represents the maximum number of actions allowed. 
  Your array dp would be 2D with one dimension of length nums.length and 
  the other of length k. In the top-down approach, we had a function dp. 
  We want these two to be equivalent. For example, the value of dp(4, 6) 
  can now be found in dp[4][6].
2. Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function. 
  In the example we just looked at, we had dp(0) = dp(1) = 0. We can initialize 
  our dp array values to 0 to implicitly set this base case. As you'll see 
  soon, other problems will have more complicated base cases.
3. Write a for-loop(s) that iterate over your state variables. If you have 
  multiple state variables, you will need nested for-loops. These loops 
  should start iterating from the base cases and end at the answer state.
4. Now, each iteration of the inner-most loop represents a given state, 
  and is equivalent to a function call to the same state in top-down. 
  Copy-paste the logic from your function into the for-loop and change the 
  function calls to accessing your array. All dp(...) changes into dp[...].
5. We're done! dp is now an array populated with the answer to the original 
  problem for all possible states. Return the answer to the original problem, 
  by changing return dp(...) to return dp[...].
